Part 1
The goal of Part 1 is to create the URI used to generate the QR code.
The ACCOUNTNAME and ISSUER provided by the user is encoded using the provided urlEncode() function.
SECRET is checked to ensure its length is 20. If not, a trailing (not leading as specified on the handout)
pad of 0s is created and the secret is then cancatenated to the pad. 
The hex string is converted to a byte array, and this byte array is then encoded in Base-32 using the provided base32_encode() function.
The URI for the HOTP and TOTP is then created with numerous strcat and the URI is then displayed with the displayQRcode() function.

Part 2
The secret hex string is again padded with trailing zeroes.
The first we construct the inner sha block by taking (secret_key^0x36) and concatenate with counter.
To calculate HOTP, set counter = 1. To calculate TOTP, set counter to unix_time divided by 30.
Then construct the outer sha block by taking (secret_key^0x5c) and concatenate with SHA1(inner block).
HMAC is the SHA(outer block).
HMAC is truncated according to the spec sheet.
OTP is the trunctated value mod 1000000.
